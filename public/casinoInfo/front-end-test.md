##Casino Developer Test

Use Symfony to build a games list casino lobby make sure the code is structured
well and scalable like for a real project. Feel free to add the anything you
feel would add to the games list such as filtering.

### Functionality
1. Load games list from Provider Json or Database
2. Search for a game
3. View Game Image and Name

### Nice to haves
- Migrations, Lazy Loading, Docker Containerised App

### Other Requirements
* Even though this is a small project, structure and architecture should mimic a large project.
* The code should obviously follow best practices (DRY, maintainable, testable, etc.).
* Feel free to add any other features you think might be useful for example: Filters.

### Tools We Use:
* [Symfony](https://symfony.com)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org)
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org)

### Ideas:
* Go on our Casinos that we support (www.lapalingo.com and www.platincasino.com)
* What would you improve & suggest for performance and user experience on these casinos.

When you are done, send a link to your repository on Github or send an email with the code to development@united-remote.com
